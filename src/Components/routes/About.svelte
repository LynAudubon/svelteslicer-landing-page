    <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Despite the growing popularity of Svelte, current development tools for this front-end framework is very limited. Prior to Svelte Slicer, there was not an apparent tool featuring time travel along along with rendering of state. We saw the need for a more robust development tool which can alleviate the challenges developers face in the debugging process.
    </p>

    <p>
        We were inspired by popular development tools for React and Redux to go above and beyond the existing Svelte DevTool for easier debugging of Svelte Applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Svelte Slicer will fill a gap in the current Svelte ecosystem by providing a more robust and intuitive tool for debugging, encouraging further adoption of this up-and-coming technology.
