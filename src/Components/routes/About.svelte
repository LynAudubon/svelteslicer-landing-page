    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Despite the growing popularity of Svelte, current development tools for this front-end framework are very limited. At the time of architecting Svelte Slicer, we were unable to locate a tool that featured time travel along with re-rendering of state. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We developed Svelte Slicer as a Chrome Developer Tool that allows the user to view and traverse graphical and textual representations of the applicationâ€™s state throughout its lifecycle, helping developers to more efficiently identify state-related bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were inspired by existing devtools when deciding on practical features that would improve the Svelte developer experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Svelte Slicer will fill a gap in the current Svelte ecosystem by providing a practical and intuitive tool for debugging, encouraging further adoption of this up-and-coming technology.

        Developed at the innovative technology accelerator: <a href="https://opensourcelabs.io/"> OSLabs </a>
